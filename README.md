## Why this fork?

This is a fork of the cloak library developed at Bocoup. As the original project is not maintained, this fork has been upgraded to support newer dependencies versions (most importantly socket-io). The fork does not change the API of the library.

You can install it with:

```bash
npm install --save @vstirbu/cloak
```
